# Navigator Assist — Backend

Express.js API server for the Navigator Assist website.

## Features

- **Contact form API** — validates, stores to JSON, sends email notification + auto-reply
- **Admin dashboard API** — list, mark-read, delete submissions (Basic Auth protected)
- **Rate limiting** — 5 submissions per IP per 15 minutes
- **Static file serving** — serves the frontend from `/public`

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:

EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
EMAIL_TO=navigatorassist@gmail.com
ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASS=your_secure_password
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.com
```

> **Gmail App Password**: Go to Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords.
> Generate one for "Mail" and paste it as `EMAIL_PASS`.

### 3. Run the server

```bash
# Production
npm start

# Development (auto-restart on changes)
npm run dev
```

Server will start at: **http://localhost:3000**

The frontend (`public/index.html`) is served automatically.
